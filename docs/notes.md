# Notes


## TODO

- Break the Component form into multiple subforms for convenience when editing. 
	-  This will also make it easier to allow auto-generated schema for new component types.
	- But this means I'll have to change schema so that data.type is no longer used, just a root-level type. This shouldn't be a problem; v4 schema already requires it.

- Search for components
	- UI
	- API
