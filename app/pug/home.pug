      h5 Messages from the Development Team:
      ul
        li <strong>2022-03-29</strong> - The 'production' deployment is now live and accessible from outside the Fermilab firewall by any user with an appropriate Auth0 account or Fermilab SSO.  The development team will conduct some initial testing to confirm that the basic functionality and interface are working correctly, but please do report any issues that we may have missed.  The 'staging' deployment will be rolled out at a later date, and access to that will be restricted to only a select group of users for the time being (this may change in the future).
        li <strong>2022-03-18</strong> - Welcome to version 2 of the DUNE APA Construction Database!  This database was previously known as <strong>Sietch</strong>, and initially developed by Nathaniel Tagg.  The current development team have now completed a major refactoring of the entire database code, as well as streamlining the Docker environment setup and OKD configuration.  This should not significantly change the web interface, but will considerably improve the stability, reliability and long-term ease-of-use of the code itself.
